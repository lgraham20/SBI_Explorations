# SBI_Explorations
Experimenting with Simulation Based Inference (https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/) on theoretical and (in the future) real data.
Currently exploring how SBI compares to Bayesian analysis on Gaussian data.

The func.py and var.py files contain global variables or functions that are used by the SBI v. Gaussian scripts but not
the involved in the machine learning.
